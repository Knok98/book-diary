Book manager

Project Description:

  The main goal of this project was to create an editable list of books that the user has already read using CRUD and Google Book API.

  In this app users can add books by writing their names and the Google API will return information like description, registration NO, genre, author, image 
  of the first result which will be found.

  Users then can add their own opinions and ratings by editing specific books through the form.

  For better user overview some information like registration NO ( ISBN etc. ) and description are hidden and can be opened by the view button.

  sorting is managed by form where the user can choose by which type and method  he would like to view his books.

Used technologies: 
  Javascript, EJS, Axios, Postgres, .envi, Bootstrap, (more information in package.json file) 


Difficulties:
  One of the main problems that occurred was that I was not able to create a module window for the "view more information window",  It did not matter if it was with 
  or without Bootstrap.

Future goals:
  I would like to add some improvements like adding more users with their own lists so It will require authorization login for editing only their feeds and the option 
  to view other user's books and their reviews.
  Another crucial part would be build own CSS for omitting Bootstrap ( the reason for using it was to have quick data representation )

More Prerequisites:
  For using this app it is crucial to have a Google API key.
